#Simple Madlibs v2

Items needed: 
1) Folder labeled as 'resources' inside of the current working directory.
2) Four .csv files named 'nouns.csv' 'verbs.csv' 'adjectives.csv' 'sentences.csv' inside of 'resources' folder. 
   Each .csv file contains list of string items. 
   
Program info: 
Upon execution, the program will ask for a user name. If the user name is new (.csv file in 'references') a new one will be created.
User will then be asked to enter a number. That number will be used to select a noun, verb, and adjective and put it into a sentence. 
Input y to continue or n to exit. 
Upon exit, the new madlib sentences will be appended to the previously saved madlib game. Unless a new user was createt, it will add 
the new madlib sentences to the new user .csv file.
